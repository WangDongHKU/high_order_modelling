Collective interaction of individuals in various settings is crucial for exposure to infections during the COVID-19 pandemic, intensifying infectious risks through mechanisms such as social reinforcement, clustering and superspreading events. However, standard epidemic models often fail to adequately capture such heterogeneity, as they typically overlook the higher-order structural patterns inherent in collective behaviors. 

Importantly, spatiotemporal variation in transmission represents a defining characteristic of the pandemic. Yet, systematic efforts to quantify this variation longitudinally at a national scale—particularly those that harness high-resolution data and complex network analysis—remain scarce. 

This study introduces a higher-order simplicial model that integrates human mobility data to investigate the role of social reinforcement in SARS-CoV-2 transmission systematically. By reconstructing the transmission network, we delineate the evolving transmission patterns throughout the pandemic. 

Our analyses reveal that a median of 7–13% of infections across provinces can be attributed to social reinforcement, while collective interaction contributed to a 21–41% increase in susceptibility. Social reinforcement further amplified transmissibility by 67–78% across periods of strain variants. 

The reconstructed transmission networks expose pronounced spatiotemporal heterogeneity, with dynamic critical locations, fluctuating movement patterns, and evolving cluster structures, as illuminated through complex network analysis. The influence of human mobility on transmission was quantified via infectious population outflows and effective distance metrics, with reduced effective distances associated with heightened infection risks.

Overall, our findings advance a data-driven framework for understanding epidemic dynamics through higher-order modeling and spatiotemporal network analysis. Precise characterization of collective interactions and mobility-driven transmission patterns may inform targeted public health strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens.
