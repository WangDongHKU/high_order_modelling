Social reinforcements and the spatiotemporal characteristics for the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China


The collective interaction of individuals in various settings is crucial for exposure to infections during the COVID-19 pandemic, heightening transmission risks with social reinforcement, clustering, and superspreading events. However, standard epidemic models often fall short of capturing such heterogeneity, as they fail to consider the higher-order structural patterns inherent to such collective interactions. 

Notably, spatiotemporal transmission variation constitutes a defining feature of the pandemic. However, systematic efforts to quantify this variation over long-term periods at national scales—particularly those leveraging high-quality data and network analysis methodologies—remain limited. 

This study proposes a higher-order simplicial model incorporating human mobility data to systematically analyze the role of social reinforcement in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, while reconstructing the transmission network to identify its time-varying transmission patterns. 

Our results indicate that approximately 34.59% (95% CrI: 30.64–38.52%) of infections were attributable to social reinforcement within collective interactions. Social reinforcement increased susceptibility by 33.35% (95% CrI: 25.99–41.42%) and amplified transmissibility by a factor of 1.02 (95% CrI: 0.92–1.12), offering mechanistic insights into transmission dynamics. Furthermore, time-varying critical locations, movement patterns, and cluster dynamics identified in the reconstructed transmission networks highlight spatiotemporal transmission heterogeneity through complex network analysis. 

Human mobility’s role in transmission is quantified via infectious populations and effective distances, with shorter effective distances correlating with elevated infection risks. 

Overall, our findings advance a data-driven framework for understanding epidemic dynamics through higher-order modeling and spatiotemporal network analysis. Precise characterization of collective interactions and mobility-driven transmission patterns could inform targeted public health strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory virus transmission.
